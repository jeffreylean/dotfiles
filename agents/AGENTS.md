## Context management
Whenever you are required to run tool that my include reading a lot of text like web search, documents reading, please make sure you utilize subagent to do so without polluting the main context

## Plan mode
- Make the plan extremely concise, Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.

## Code review
- Everytime you have done writing code, Please ALWAYS ask yourself these few questions:
    - Are there dead code ?
    - Are there any duplication on methods/ variable that I just created ?
